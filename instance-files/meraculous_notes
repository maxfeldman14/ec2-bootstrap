== Richard's notes on how to get Meraculous running ==
I am assuming that you have no experience with Perl, because I have no
experience with Perl. Refer to $MERACULOUS_ROOT/Meraculous-MANUAL.txt

=== Installing required software ===
Install this stuff:
  g++ version 4.3.2
  make
  perl 5.10.1
  blast 2.2.18
  boost::libraries 1.42.0 ( no compile needed, only headers are used )
  swig 1.3.39

Debian:
# Update sources
apt-get update
apt-get install g++
apt-get install make
apt-get install perl
apt-get install blast2
apt-get install libboost-dev
apt-get install swig1.3

=== Installing Perl modules and their dependencies ===
As far as I can tell, CPAN is the standard Perl package manager. I am learning
all of this from http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/TWiki/HowToInstallCpanModules. 
You can run it in shell mode with the following command:

  (sudo) perl -MCPAN -e shell

First update CPAN itself by running this command:

  install Bundle::CPAN

This downloads and compiles all the files for CPAN, and takes a while. When it
finishes, it may give you a list of dependencies that it needs to install for
CPAN. After installing those, it'll give you a list of dependencies for those
dependencies. Repeat several times (maybe I'm stupid and don't know how to
install all dependencies at once without requiring the user to type in 'y' every
couple minutes) until you finish installing everything. Then reload CPAN with
the following command:

  reload cpan

Now to install the dependencies for Meraculous. They are:
- Log::Log4perl
- Date/Calc.pm
- XMLRPC::Lite

Note the capitalization of Log4perl. Meraculous-MANUAL.txt misspelled it.
Repeat the previous steps of typing in 'y' every couple of minutes (actually,
seconds, since it's a lot faster with these packages).

=== Setting environment variables ===
Note that ROOT should point to the Meraculous root
  export ROOT=/home/ubuntu/cs294/Meraculous-1.4.4-rel
Add the MERACULOUS and mod_rqc folders to $PERL5LIB
  export PERL5LIB=${PERL5LIB}:${ROOT}/MERACULOUS:${ROOT}/mod_rqc/

Add the boost header files directory to $BOOST_DIR. Mine were installed at
/usr/include/boost
  export BOOST_DIR=/usr/include/boost

Run MERACULOUS/build_swig. I'm not sure if this is necessary since it looks like
the tarball seemed to have the stuff compiled already. But I guess it's safer to
compile it for your platform. Their script is retarded and hardcodes the perl 
dev path to perl5.10, so fix that.

=== Configuring files ===
I just ignored everything here because I don't understand it

=== Running meraculous ===
They advise you to copy the config files in start_files/, so I did so. I copied
them to config/. Open up meraculous.params. Add your meraculous root path to
the "release_root" config.  And to the best of my knowledge, uncomment the
lib_seq line with the dataset you want to use, assuming that you want to run
the Pichia datasets that they posted.  Change the path of the dataset (the
/PICHIA/DATA/HCT*) to point to whichever one you want to use.

cd into the directory where you copied the config files and run the command:
  perl ${ROOT}/start_files/meraculous.pl -config=meraculous.params -stop=meraculous_mercount -output_dir=${output_dir}

output_dir NEEDS TO BE AN ABSOLUTE PATH

Pray that this works. Check output/logs/errors.log for errors.
